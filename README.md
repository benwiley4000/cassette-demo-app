# cassette-demo-app

This is a quickly-developed demo media player app built with [Cassette](https://github.com/benwiley4000/cassette). Its purpose is to demonstrate how Cassette can be used to quickly prototype features in a media player application.

Its intended use is a "live demo" where we step through each commit, starting with the first.

This branch was prepared for the Forward JS Ottawa conference, 10-11 April 2019.
